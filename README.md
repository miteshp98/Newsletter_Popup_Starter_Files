# Welcome to Codewell! ðŸ‘‹ Newsletter Popup Starter File

Codewell's aim is to provide you with real-world design templates that you can use to practice your HTML and CSS projects.

Free or paid, all templates are high quality and will make great portfolio pieces.

### Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size.

### I've completed the challenge, now what?

Hello Code Well team! I'm excited to submit my solution for the Newsletter popup challenge. This project allowed me to showcase my skills in creating a responsive and interactive Newsletter popup.

Implemented a fully responsive design to ensure optimal viewing on various devices and screen sizes.

Flexbox for Layout: Utilized Flexbox, a CSS layout model, to create flexible and efficient layouts, ensuring elements adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and resolutions.

Relative Units for Responsiveness: Implemented relative units such as percentages, em, or rem for various elements, ensuring responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes.

```css
.title-image-cont {
  background: url(../Assets/Pattern.png) no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
  background-color: #2355f2;
```
